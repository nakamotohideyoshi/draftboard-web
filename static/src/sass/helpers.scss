 * Helper classes for small, common things that don't make a lot of sense to create a class for.

 * “BEM shouldn’t be the goal of a project, it should be something you keep in mind as you’re
 * developing and apply where useful. Don’t get too carried away trying to stick to some
 * theoretical ‘standard’. Helper classes (like .pull-right or .text-center) are totally cool
 * to co-exist with BEM. Where you might have had class="story--centered", class="story text-center"
 * will do just as well (perhaps even better).''
