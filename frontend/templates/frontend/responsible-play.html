  <h2>Limitations on Deposits</h2>

  <p>

  <p>
    Note that residents of Tennessee will not be granted an increase in their deposit limit until they have played 51 contests on Draftboard.  In order for residents of Tennessee or Maryland to have their deposit limit increased a resident shall provide proof of a) individual net worth, or joint net worth with that person's spouse, in excess of $500,000, or b) individual income in excess of $150,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with that person's spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years.  In either case there should be a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year.  Maryland residents must reapply each year to maintain a monthly deposit limit in excess of $1,000.
  </p>

  <h2>Parental Controls</h2>

  <p>
    Draftboard verifies the age of all users upon account setup.  If you believe someone under the age of 18 (21 in Massachusetts, 19 in Nebraska or Canada) is playing on Draftboard through their own account or one registered to someone else, please contact Customer Support at support@draftboard.com.  We will promptly close any account being utilized by a minor and refund all funds in the account within five business days.  If minors have access to your computer, consider installing parental control software which assists in blocking access to Draftboard and other age-restricted sites.
