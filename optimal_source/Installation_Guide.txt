Following steps are mentioned with respect to Linux/Macintosh Operating Systems:


1.If Ubuntu/Macintosh machine does not have python 3x version installed then we have to upgrade the python version.

	sudo apt-get upgrade python

	Python upgraded version can be confirmed using following command:
	sudo python3 -V
	Sample Output: Python 3.4.0

2.Install/ Upgrade required python packages before starting NetBanxSDK setup.
	
	Urllib3 and certifi are two necessary packages need to be installed before starting NetBanxSDK setup.

	Python may have a pre-installed packages for urllib3 which may not be the latest version.
	To install/upgrade use following commands:
	sudo python3 –m pip install urllib3==1.10.2
	sudo python3 –m pip install certifi

3.Install NetBanxSDK using following command:

	Goto this directory: PythonSDK/src
	Command: sudo python3 setup.py install

	In case if a tar file is provided, execute following command:
	sudo python3 –m pip install <tar ball file>

	Example: sudo python3 –m pip install OptimalPayment==1.1

4.To execute automation  test scripts, execute following steps:

	Goto this directory: PythonSDK/TestCases
	Command: sudo python3 StartExecution.py

	Upon successful execution of StartExecution.py an html file will be generated in the same directory named Report.html.
	This file will provide a detailed report of all test cases for 3 API’s:
		I. Customer Vault Service
	       II. Card Payment Service
	      III. Hosted Payment Service

	Note:
	Green mark indicates API has a success response, whereas
	Red mark indicates failure response.
